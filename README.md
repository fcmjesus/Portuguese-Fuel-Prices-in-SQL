# Portuguese Fuel Prices 2008-2023 

MySQL project analysing data on fuel prices in Portugal since 2008, considering the three most popular fuel types in Portugal (diesel, gasoline 95 and gasoline 98) and then focusing on the one I use the most, diesel.

Data was taken from the DGEG (Portuguese Geology and Energy Department) website as a CSV file. 

Initial data cleaning was done using Excel, splitting the dataset in two and converting data from long to wide format using a pivot table. Date format was also updated to facilitate import into MySQL.

Further data cleaning and data analysis done on MySQL. Comment and explanations in the SQL file.
